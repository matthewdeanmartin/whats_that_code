If a packaging strategy is being used

- Problems should fail a build if the app can't be packaged.

Even if no packaging is being used

- Dependencies need to be in place for a build to pass
- Dependencies should be pinned tight enough to get repeatable builds
- Not so tight that you can't get security fixes and fixes necessary to interact with
a changing world.
